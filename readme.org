* How it Works?
This extension has two main parts.
+ A background script containing the core logic of the bot waiting for incoming messages.
+ An injected script to process incoming messages.

The reason for the two separate scripts is due to the limited access different parts of the Chrome extensions have. This is explained further in the Wiki.

* Goal
The main goal of this chat bot is to simply augment the user experience by developing additional functionality that is otherwise not provided. These features include autodownloading media, sport events tracker, games, and commands. Ultimately the aim is to eventually make this chat bot obsolete as the platform adds features to make it redundant.

* Roadmap
+ Refactor majority of the code, priority is files in =/web/=.
  + Move repeated code to =helper.js= to minimise duplication.
  + Minimise dependencies.
 Â + Explore switching to something like Typescript to stay sane
+ Finalise applications feature to allow for functionality too complex for a one line command.
+ Look into separating the core of the chat bot into a local application and keep the chrome extension to send / receive messages.
+ Develop Wiki page to document the design of the extension.
  + This is an ongoing activity, and when redundancy is found, the changes are made to the code.

* How to run
+ Clone the repository
+ Create =config.js= under the =lib= folder and follow the same format as =config_example.js=
  + This is where you add the whitelist for the groups that your chatbot can be in. If the group is not in the whitelist, the bot will automatically leave.
+ Run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
npm install --save
webpack
#+END_SRC

This will install the dependencies and also build =background.js= which is required by the chrome extension. 
Afterwards, load the directory as an unpacked extension.

* TODO Todo
- [ ] Add support for YouTube videos/ +Streamable+ / +Oddshot+ / +Instagram+
- [ ] Add more games 
- [ ] Extension UI for easier configuration
- [ ] Better logging
